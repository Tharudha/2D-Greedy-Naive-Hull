# 2D-Greedy-Naive-Hull
Creating a 2D Greedy or Naive Convex Hull algorithm from scratch can be quite complex, but I can certainly outline the general steps and provide a high-level overview of the algorithm. The Convex Hull problem aims to find the smallest convex polygon that encloses a given set of points in 2D space
